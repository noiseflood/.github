# Noiseflood

I am making a music cartoon called Noiseflood about a world flooded by noise. It explores the various ways groups of people deal with the flood: some build bubbles to silence the noise, some arm themselves with sonic weapons to counter or cancel the noise, some become the noise itself. The hero turns the noise into music.
